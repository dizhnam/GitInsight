# GitInsight

## Introduction

GitInsight offers unparalleled insights into Git repositories for developers, project managers, and non-technical users. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 and advanced data indexing, GitInsight simplifies querying Git commits and understanding project trends.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up GitInsight from scratch, covering both the frontend and backend.

## our application is now live:

Note: If you get into an issue "No response from the server", its because your browser is not setup to allow the origin. To fix this issue, please follow the below steps-
- open new tab in the same browser and go to the link: https://34.229.180.222/fetch_commits
- click on advance and then proceed to use option.
- This should give you Method Not Allowed page which simply means you have successfully allowed the origin.
- Now try accessing the app again in the same browser. It should work fine then.
